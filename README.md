My Advent of Code solutions

Solutions are organized by year and day.

Answers can be run via the dotnet CLI as follows:

`dotnet run -- --year 2015 --day 03`

You can also use -y and -d as aliases and omit the year and day prefixes. The following is equivalent to the above command:

`dotnet run -- -y 15 -d 3`
