My [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions.

## Building
Requires [.NET 5](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

`dotnet restore`

`dotnet build`

## Running
Answers can be run via the dotnet CLI as follows (from the root of the project):

`dotnet run -- --year 2015 --day 03`

You can also use -y and -d as aliases and omit the year and day prefixes. The following is equivalent to the above command:

`dotnet run -- -y 15 -d 3`
